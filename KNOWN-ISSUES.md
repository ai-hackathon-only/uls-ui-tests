# Known issues

Each entry has an id (`KI-<n>`) used by `test.fail()` annotations and by
`tests/support/known-errors.js`. Entries for ULS bugs give skin, device, user,
steps, expected vs actual, a screenshot under `docs/`, and the ULS and core
commits from `Special:Version`.

## KI-0
Not a ULS bug. The test wiki has no `/favicon.ico` (404), and Chrome logs
"Failed to load resource: 404" on every page. Allow-listed in
`tests/support/known-errors.js` by its URL only.

## KI-1
**Cologne Blue has no ULS language button.**

- Skin: Cologne Blue (`cologneblue`). Devices: desktop, tablet, mobile. Users: anonymous and logged in (all six rows).
- Steps: open `/w/index.php?title=QA_ULS_search_codes&useskin=cologneblue&useformat=desktop`, look for the language button.
- Expected: a ULS language button, as in the other desktop skins. The wiki lists Cologne Blue in
  `$wgULSLanguageSelectorV2SupportedSkins` (`LocalSettings.php:497`).
- Actual: no button. `mw.loader.getState( 'ext.uls.rewrite.entrypoints' )` stays `registered` (never loads),
  there is no `#p-lang`, `#p-lang-btn`, `.mw-interlanguage-selector`, `.uls-trigger` or `.uls-settings-trigger`.
  The page shows only the plain "In other languages" links (24 `.interlanguage-link`, each list shown twice).
- Screenshot: [docs/ki-1-cologneblue-desktop-anon.png](docs/ki-1-cologneblue-desktop-anon.png) (desktop, anon).
- Found on: ULS `2b186dc023e278d88bf91d4713ae021ce2306515` (13:54, 6 November 2026),
  MediaWiki core 1.48.0-alpha `f7d0709ef0c28166422137c3167b0a992b999afd`.
- In the suite: `tests/support/known-issues.js` marks the trigger-based groups (open, search,
  interlanguage, suggested, settings, keyboard, rtl, small-screen) on Cologne Blue rows as expected failures.
